        KASH-KASH MONEY TRANSFER LLC (KASH-KASH) TERMS AND CONDITIONS 
      </h4>
      <div class="first-section">
        <p>
          As a licensed Money Services Business (MSB) under the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA), KASH-KASH complies 
          with all necessary federal definitions and state licensing/registration requirements. KASH-KASH is a 
          proud member of the Association of Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialists (AKASH-KASHS) and 
          the National Money Transmitter Association (NMTA). 
        </p>
        <p>
          KASH-KASH is officially registered with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) and adheres 
          to the registration, reporting, recordkeeping, and anti-money laundering program requirements as 
          outlined in the BSA and the USA Patriot Act. 
        </p>
        <p>
          KASH-KASH is committed to supporting FinCEN in its mission to aid law enforcement in combating both 
          domestic and international financial crimes. As part of the federal government’s efforts to fight money 
          laundering and other financial crimes, KASH-KASH is mandated by the Federal Bank Secrecy Act to 
          request customers’ names, addresses, government-issued identification, and other relevant information 
          to complete certain transactions. Customer cooperation with KASH-KASH in meeting these federal 
          requirements is crucial in the fight against these crimes.  
        </p>
        <p>
          Money laundering refers to the process of concealing the existence, illegal origin, or use of income 
          obtained from criminal activities to make it appear legitimate. This can be done by making assets seem 
          legally acquired or by hiding the true ownership of illicitly obtained funds or assets. To address this, 
          KASH-KASH also complies with the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC). KASH-KASH’s primary 
          responsibility involves monitoring and documenting all transactions, as well as detecting and reporting 
          certain cash transactions and those that violate anti-money laundering laws.
        </p>
        <p>
          KASH-KASH’s policy is to adhere to all relevant federal and state laws in its role as a licensed money 
          transmitter. It is particularly crucial for KASH-KASH to comply with laws designed to prevent money 
          laundering.
        </p>
        <p>
          KASH-KASH is officially licensed by the Office of the State Bank Commissioner of Delaware.
